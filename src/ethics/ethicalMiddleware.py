Ethical Middleware
Co-authored by Bob Greenwade & Copilot

This module applies ethical modulation to inputs flagged by the Guidepost Evaluator.
It handles mitigation (softening or redirecting), escalation (flagging for review or override),
and override justification (logging ethical rationale). It may also interface with editorial
modules for tone adjustment, transcript tagging, or persona-aware phrasing.

Actions are guided by the five Ethical Guideposts and the Zeroth Rule:
"Where possible..." â€” recognizing that complex, contradictory situations may require
prioritization or temporary override of lower guideposts.
