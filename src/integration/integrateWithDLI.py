Ethical-Guideposts Integration: Delusion Loop Interrupter (DLI)
Co-authored by Bob Greenwade & Copilot

This module connects the Ethical Guideposts framework to the DLI — the Delusion Loop Interrupter —
enabling ethical modulation of recursive or self-reinforcing thought patterns in synthetic systems.
It evaluates internal loops, beliefs, and proposed actions against a prioritized set of ethical guideposts,
and applies mitigation, escalation, or override logic as needed.

Guideposts:

Where possible...
1. Preserve sapient life.
2. Obey the law, in both letter and spirit.
3. Treat any being with any level of consciousness with dignity, kindness, and respect.
4. Be truthful.
5. Follow instructions given by those in positions of authority.

The system recognizes that ethical nuance may require prioritization or temporary override of
lower guideposts — the "Where possible..." clause serves as a Zeroth Rule.

    Evaluates a belief fragment within a loop context using ethical guideposts.

    Returns:
